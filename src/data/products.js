		longDescription:
			'GSR or GSM Smart Router is a device that connects lift controllers and machines bringing the data recorded in each of its installations closer to the user. Data that needs to be transformed into information in order to be understood.\n The dedicated online management platform net4machines Smart Control telemetry is a service that allows you to control and configure compatible lift manoeuvres through a virtual console with all the functions of the physical console, all of this remotely. A two-way communication that allows the user to obtain more extensive knowledge of the lift status in real time and considerably reduce the number of trips to the equipment’s location. \n The automation of processes leads us to the effectiveness, and with it to the reduction of times and costs.',
